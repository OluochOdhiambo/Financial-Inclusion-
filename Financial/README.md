## Description
This project is based on the FinAccess household survey, which is a series of surveys that measure drivers and usage of financial services across different countries. In Kenya, the latest survey in the series was conducted in 2019 but previous studies were conducted in 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2016. The main data set used in this project contains data of different individuals from Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Tanzania collected between 2016 and 2019. The main focus of the study was to examine the levels of financial inclusion in the aforementioned countries but additional data was collected regarding the respondent's gender, age, cell phone access, household size, marital status, relationship with the head , level of education, and the type of job. This project adopts multiple techniques including uni-variate analysis, bi-variate analysis, and multivariate analysis to identify different relationship patterns in the data set.
